# Carbon-Footprint-Tracker
### Carbon Footprint tracker aims to create an impact by making users aware of their carbon footprint. They’re bringing a change playing their part to sustain the environment by taking a small step that is; reducing their carbon footprint.

## Browser Extension for tracing Carbon footprint of a user’s mail account. 

The Browser Extension for Tracing Carbon Footprint of Email Accounts is designed to calculate and track the carbon footprint of an email account. The carbon footprint of an email account refers to the amount of carbon emissions generated from the energy used to send and receive emails.

## The Carbon Footprint of Emails
The carbon footprint of an email refers to the amount of carbon emissions generated from the energy used to send and receive emails. The problem with the carbon footprint of emails is that it can add up quickly, especially with the increasing number of emails sent and received daily.

Data centers consume a large amount of energy to power and cool servers, storage systems, and other equipment. The carbon footprint of data centers can be significant, as the energy used in these facilities is often generated from non-renewable sources such as coal, natural gas, and oil.

One of the main sources of the carbon footprint of emails is the energy used to run data centers, which store and process emails.

In addition, the carbon footprint of emails also includes the energy used to manufacture, distribute, and dispose of electronic devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets used to send and receive emails.

The problem with the carbon footprint of emails is that it contributes to global greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change. It is important to reduce the carbon footprint of emails by using more energy-efficient technologies, reducing the number of emails sent, and using eco-friendly electronic devices.
